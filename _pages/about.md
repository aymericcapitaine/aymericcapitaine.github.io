Hi everyone! I am a second year PhD student at Ecole Polytechnique (CMAP) and Inria Paris (Sierra). I work under the supervision of [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/), [Alain Durmus](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=nqLKv6EAAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Etienne Boursier](https://eboursier.github.io/).

I study decision-making under uncertainty in multi-agent systems, at the intersection of Game Theory, Online Optimization and Statistical Learning. 

I also serve as the Project Manager of the [Ocean](https://oceanerc.com/) ERC Synergy project.
