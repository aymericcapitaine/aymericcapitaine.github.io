Hi everyone! I am a second year PhD student at Ecole Polytechnique (CMAP) and Inria Paris (Sierra). I work under the supervision of Michael I. Jordan, Alain Durmus and Etienne Boursier. I study decision-making under uncertainty in multi-agent systems, at the intersection of Game Theory, Online Optimization and Statistical Learning.
